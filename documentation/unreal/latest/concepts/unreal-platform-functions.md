---

All Oculus headsets can access the Oculus Platform which supports social gaming and applications, as well as revenue generation functions. 

## Overview

The [Oculus Platform](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/book-plat-sdk-intro/) provides support for:

* **Identity** - Personalize the application by using the user's friends list. Allow users to easily find and connect with friends.
* **Social and Community** - Foster active communities and encourage meaningful interactions in your app. Bring users around the globe together for shared social experiences.
* **Engagement** - Engaged users return more frequently and spend more time in VR. Incentivize users to return, interact, and invest in your application.
* **Revenue** - Maximize the return on your application by offering the right items and experiences at the right time in VR.
* **Security** - Protect your application and users with the robust security of the Oculus Platform authentication.


It is not possible to access the Oculus Platform features via Blueprints at this time. However, you can add these features to your applications as described in the Unreal sections of the [Oculus Platform](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/book-plat-sdk-intro/) documentation. Several useful links are provided below.
