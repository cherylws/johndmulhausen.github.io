title: Set Display Frequency
---

Sets the display frequency (frame rate) for Oculus Go to either 60 Hz or 72 Hz.

## Overview

The Oculus headsets support different display frequencies (frame rates). The Oculus Rift is always set to 90 Hz. Gear VR is always set to 60 Hz. However, Oculus Go can be set to either 60 Hz or 72 Hz. This blueprint sets the display frequency, in frames per second, for the Oculus Go to a floating point value that is either 60.0 or 72.0.
