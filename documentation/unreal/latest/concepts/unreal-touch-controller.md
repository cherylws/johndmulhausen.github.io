title: Oculus Touch Controller
---
Oculus Touch is the standard tracked controller for Rift. 

Touch may be used to emulate Microsoft XInput API gamepads without any code changes. However, you must account for the missing logical and ergonomic equivalences between the two types of controllers. For more information, see [Emulating Gamepad Input with Touch](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-gamepad-emulation-touch/) in our PC SDK Developer Guide.

## Handling Controller Input with Blueprints

Your application can use Blueprints to access every input event generated by the Gear VR controller. For a full description of these blueprints, please see [Mapping Oculus Controller Input to Blueprint Events](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-controller-input-mapping-reference/ "This reference section describes how Oculus controller actions (such as touchpad presses) map to the corresponding events that can be handled via blueprints.").

This guide describes how to use Unreal Blueprints to control haptic effects on Touch or Xbox controllers. 
* **[Guardian System Boundary Component](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-boundary/)**  
OculusBoundaryComponent exposes an API for interacting with the Oculus Guardian System.
