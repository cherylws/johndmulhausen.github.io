title: Unreal Game Engine
---
Unreal is distributed with Oculus plugins which make it easy to develop applications that work with Oculus Go, Oculus Rift, and Samsung Gear VR. 

## Overview

![](/images/documentation-unreal-latest-0.png)  
The Unreal Game Engine provides integrated support for VR applications that target the Oculus Go, Oculus Rift, and Samsung Gear VR headsets. This enables your applications to automatically support stereoscopic rendering, orientation tracking, and positional tracking (on the Oculus Rift). 

Your applications must explicitly target the headset where they will be deployed. Oculus Go and Gear VR applications use the [Oculus Mobile SDK](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/book-intro/). Oculus Rift applications use the [PC SDK](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/pcsdk-intro/). Setup and development differ substantially between the two development environments. For Unreal developers, this document is your main guide for targeting these headsets, although cross references are provided for the Oculus Mobile SDK and PC SDK developer guides, as well as the Unreal guides from Epic Games.

The easiest way to create Unreal applications is to use Unreal Blueprints, which is a visual programming system. Here is a portion of a Blueprint script which includes Oculus-specific functions:

If you are not already familiar with Blueprints, [Epic Games](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/) provides several videos and documents to help you get started. You should have a basic working knowledge of Blueprints programming before proceeding with this developer guide.

## How to use this guide

**Quick Start**: To get started developing Unreal applications for the Oculus headset that you wish to target, please see:

* [Oculus Go: Quick Start](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-quick-start-guide-go/ "This guide covers everything you need to know to get started developing Unreal applications for the Oculus Go.")
* [Gear VR: Quick Start](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-quick-start-guide-gearvr/ "This guide covers everything you need to know to get started developing Unreal applications for Gear VR.")
* [Oculus Rift: Quick Start](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-quick-start-guide-rift/ "This guide covers everything you need to know to get started developing Unreal applications for the Oculus Rift.")
**Controllers**: To handle input events generated by the controllers (Oculus Touch, Oculus Go controller, Gear VR controller and headset touchpad), please see:

* [Controllers](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-input/ "This section describes input handling for Oculus devices."): Provides general guidance for handling controller input events. 
* [Mapping Oculus Controller Input to Blueprint Events](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-controller-input-mapping-reference/ "This reference section describes how Oculus controller actions (such as touchpad presses) map to the corresponding events that can be handled via blueprints."): Provides a complete Blueprint reference for all controller input events.
**Audio**: For an overview of VR audio features, please see:

* [Audio](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-audio/ "Audio is critical for creating a persuasive VR experience and can contribute strongly to the user's sense of immersion."): Provides a quick introduction to common audio tools for Unreal VR applications, along with pointers to external documents and code samples.
**Rendering**: To enhance rendering quality and optimize the frame rendering rate, please see:

* [Rendering](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-advanced-rendering/ "This section describes important rendering options and tools that can significantly improve your application."): Describes several rendering features, most of which are unique to specific Oculus headsets.
* [Oculus Go: Testing and Performance Analysis](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-debug-go/ "This guide describes basic testing and performance analysis for Oculus Go development in Unreal."): Describes how to optimize Oculus Go applications.
* [Gear VR: Testing and Performance Analysis](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-debug-gearvr/ "This guide describes basic testing and performance analysis for Gear VR development in Unreal."): Describes how to optimize Gear VR applications.
* [Oculus Rift: Testing and Performance Analysis](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-debug-rift/ "This guide describes basic testing and performance analysis for Oculus Rift development in Unreal."): Describes how to optimize Oculus Rift applications.
**User Experience**: To provide the best possible user experience, please see:

* [Oculus Dash](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-dash/ "This guide describes how to add Oculus Dash support to Unreal applications."): Describes how to support the Oculus Dash environment from within Unreal applications.
* [Splash Screens](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-loading-screens/ "We strongly recommend adding a loading splash screen to your Rift or mobile application. Loading splash screens are required by the Oculus Store."): Describes how to use splash screens during application load time, and during UE4 Level transition times.
* [Social Applications and Revenue](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-platform-functions/ "All Oculus headsets can access the Oculus Platform which supports social gaming and applications, as well as revenue generation functions."): Provides an overview of the Oculus Platform social and revenue functions, with links into the Oculus Platform SDK documentation.
* [Oculus Rift: Mixed Reality Capture](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-mrc/ "This guide describes how to add and configure mixed reality capture support for your Unreal application. Mixed reality capture is supported for Rift applications only."): Describes how to incorporate live video feeds into your Unreal applications.
**Reference**: For a complete reference guide to all Oculus Unreal functions, please see:

* [Blueprints Reference](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-blueprints/ "This section serves as a reference guide for the Blueprints in the Online Subsystem Oculus library."): Provides a reference for the Oculus Blueprint library.

## Related SDKs

Platform SDK

* The Oculus Platform supports features related to security, community, revenue, and engagement such as entitlement checking, matchmaking, in-app purchase, VoIP, and cloud saves. For more information on the Platform Unreal plugin, see the [Unreal Getting Started Guide](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/pgsg-unreal-gsg/) in our Platform documentation.
Avatar SDK

* The Oculus Avatar SDK includes an Unreal package to assist developers with implementing first-person hand presence for the Rift and Touch controllers. It includes avatar hand and body assets that are viewable by other users in social applications. The first-person hand models and third-person hand and body models supported by the Avatar SDK automatically pull the avatar configuration choices the user has made in Oculus Home to provide a consistent sense of identity across applications. For more information, see our [Avatar SDK Developer Guide](/documentation/avatarsdk/latest/).
Audio Resources

* The Oculus Audio SDK includes spatialization plugins (OSPs) that provide Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) spatialization and reverb modeling for audio editing tools commonly used with Unreal, including Audiokinetic Wwise and FMOD Studio. See [Audio](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-audio/ "Audio is critical for creating a persuasive VR experience and can contribute strongly to the user's sense of immersion.") for more information.
Facebook 360 Capture SDK

* This sample SDK allows game and virtual reality developers to easily and quickly integrate 360 photo/video capture capability into their applications. It is available for use with Unreal VR applications, and may be downloaded from the [Facebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebook/360-Capture-SDK).
