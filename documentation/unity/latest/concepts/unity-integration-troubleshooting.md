Verify that the HMD is plugged in and working normally. 

Verify that you have not selected D3D 9 or Windows GL as the renderer (Legacy Integration only).

## Mobile

**The app does not launch as a VR app.**

Verify that you selected **Virtual Reality Supported** in **Player Settings** before building your APK. 

**Applications fail to launch on Gear VR with error message "thread priority security exception make sure the apk is signed‚Äù.**

You must sign your application with an Oculus Signature File (osig). See "Sign your App with an Oculus Signature File" in [Preparing for Mobile Development](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-mobileprep/ "To prepare for Unity mobile development for Oculus Go and Samsung Gear VR, you must set up the Unity Editor for Android development and install the Android SDK. The Oculus Mobile SDK is not required.") for instructions.

## General Issues

**Unity 5 hangs while importing assets from SDKExamples.**

Unity 5 is known to import ETC2-compressed assets very slowly.

**Receiving OVRPlugin console errors after importing a new version of Utilities.**

Be sure to delete any previously-imported Utilities packages from your Unity project before importing a new version. If you are receiving errors and have not done so, delete the relevant folders in your project and re-import Utilities. For more information, please see [Importing the Oculus Utilities Package](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-import/ "Oculus Utilities for Unity is an optional Unity Package that includes scripts, prefabs, and other resources to assist with development.").
