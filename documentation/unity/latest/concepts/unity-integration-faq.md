---

If you’re new to Oculus development with Unity, this FAQ can answer the most common beginner questions. 

**Question**: What’s the best way to get started if you’re a beginner?

**Answer**: Browse through this FAQ, and check out our [Oculus Unity Getting Started Guide](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/book-unity-gsg/). Read through Unity’s excellent [documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) and try out some of their introductory [tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials) to get acquainted with Unity development.

When you're ready to get into the trenches, find out what the version of Unity we recommend at our [Compatibility and Requirements](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-req/) page, then download and install it. Next, build your own simple VR game by following the instructions in our [Tutorial: Build Your First VR App](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-tutorial/).

You can also browse around on our [Unity Developer Forum](https://forums.oculus.com/developer/categories/unity). 

**Question**: What are the system requirements for Unity development for Oculus? What operating systems are supported for Unity development?

**Answer**: For the most up-to-date information, see [Unity Compatibility and Requirements](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-req/). We currently support Windows and OS X for development. The Oculus Rift requires Windows 7, 8 or 10.

**Question**: What version of Unity should I use?

**Answer**: Our latest version recommendations may be found in our [Unity Compatibility and Requirements](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-req/) document. Be sure to check back regularly, as we update it frequently as new SDKs and Unity versions are released. You can find an archive of information in our [Unity-SDK Version Compatibility](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-sdk-version-compatibility/) list.

**Question**: What other tools and resources do you provide to Unity developers? 

**Answer**: To find the latest tools we provide, check out our [Other Oculus Resources for Unity Developers](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-resources/).

**Question**: What do I need to run Rift applications that I build with Unity?

**Answer**: You will need a compatible Windows PC, a Rift, and the Oculus software. For more details, see [Preparing for Rift Development](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-pcprep/)

**Question**: I want to focus on mobile development for the Samsung Gear VR. What do I need to do to get started? Do I need to download the Oculus Mobile SDK?

**Answer**: The Android SDK is required for mobile development with Unity. However, most Unity developers do not need to download the Oculus Mobile SDK, or to install Android Studio or NDK. For more details, see [Preparing for Mobile Development](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-mobileprep/).

**Question**: Can I develop a single application for both Samsung Gear VR and the Oculus Rift?

**Answer**: Yes, but when developing for both Rift and mobile platforms, keep in mind that the requirements for PC and mobile VR applications differ substantially. If you would like to generate builds for both PC and mobile from a single project, it is important to follow the more stringent mobile development best practices, as well as meeting the required 90 fps required by the Rift.

**Question**: What is the difference between the Oculus Unity 4 Legacy Integration and the Oculus Utilities for Unity? How do the differences between Unity 4 and 5 affect development?

**Answer**: All developers should use Unity 5 or later. The Unity 4 Integration is maintained for legacy purposes only. 

In Unity 4, you must import our Legacy Integration for Unity 4 unitypackage and add the supplied VR camera and player controller to your application to add Rift or Gear VR support.

**Question**: Where can I ask questions or get help?
