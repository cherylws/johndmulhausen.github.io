This guide covers developing Unity 4 games and applications for the Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear VR. 

The legacy integration provides VR support for development with **Unity 4.x** Professional and Free editions. It also includes Unity prefabs, C# scripts, sample scenes, and more to assist with development. 

Projects using **Unity 5 and later** should use the **Oculus Utilities for Unity** package instead of this integration. Developers beginning new projects should use Unity 5 or later. 

For information on recommended and supported Unity versions, see [Compatibility and Requirements](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-integration-req/).

This guide covers:

* Getting started
* Downloading and installing the Oculus Unity Integration
* Package contents
* Input Mapping
* How to use the provided samples, assets, and sample applications
* Configuring Unity VR projects for build to various targets
* Getting Started Frequently Asked Questions
* Debugging and Performance Analysis
* Getting Started Tutorial (build a simple VR game)


Most information in this guide applies to the use of the Utilities package for either Rift or Mobile development. Any exceptions are clearly indicated where they occur.

For a complete API reference, see our [Unity Developer Reference](/documentation/game-engines/latest/concepts/book-unity-reference/).

When developing for both Rift and mobile platforms, keep in mind that the requirements for PC and mobile VR applications differ substantially. If you would like to generate builds for both PC and mobile from a single project, it is important to follow the more stringent mobile development best practices.
