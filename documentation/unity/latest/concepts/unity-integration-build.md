## PC Build Target: Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X



This section describes targeting Unity project builds to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X.

## Build Settings and Player Settings

To build the demo as a standalone full screen application, you will need to change a few project settings to maximize the fidelity of the demo.

Click on **File** &gt; **Build Settings...** and select one of the following:

For Windows, set Target Platform to Windows and set Architecture to either x86 or x86 64.

For Mac, set Target Platform to Mac OS X.

Within the **Build Settings** pop-up, click **Player Settings**. Under **Resolution and Presentation**, set the values to the following:

In the **Build Settings** pop-up, select **Build**. If prompted, specify a name and location for the build.

If you are building in the same OS, the demo should start to run in full screen mode as a standalone application.

## Quality Settings



You may notice that the graphical fidelity is not as high as the pre-built demo. You will need to change some additional project settings to get a better looking scene.

Navigate to **Edit** &gt; **Project Settings** &gt; **Quality**. Set the values in this menu to the following:

The most important value to modify is **Anti aliasing** - it must be increased to compensate for the stereo rendering, which reduces the effective horizontal resolution by 50%. An anti-aliasing value of 2X is ideal - 4x may be used if you have performance to spare, and 8x usually isn't worth it.

Now rebuild the project again, and the quality should be at the same level as the pre-built demo.

## Running the Build

Now that the project is properly configured for VR, itâ€™s time to install and run the application.

PC builds create a single executable file that may be used in either Direct Display or Extended Display modes.
