---
This guide describes useful tools Oculus provides for Unity developers.

All materials are available for download from our [Developer site](/downloads/). 

The Oculus Integration, available from the Unity Asset Store [here](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/82022), provides several unityPackages in a single download, including our Utilities for Unity, Oculus Platform SDK Unity plugin, Oculus Avatar SDK Unity Plugin, and the Oculus Native Spatializer Plugin. The Unity Sample Framework is also available from the Asset Store [here](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/82503).

## Utilities Package Contents

* A Utilities package containing scripts, assets, sample scenes, et cetera. See [Oculus Utilities for Unity](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-utilities-overview/#unity-utilities-overview "This section provides an overview of the Utilities package, including its directory structure, the supplied prefabs, and several key C# scripts.") for more information.
## Samples

* Oculus Sample Framework for Unity - several sample scenes and guidelines for common and important features. See [Unity Sample Framework](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-sample-framework/ "The Oculus Unity Sample Framework provides sample scenes and guidelines for common VR-specific features such as hand presence with Oculus Touch, crosshairs, driving, hybrid mono rendering, and video rendering to a 2D textured quad.") for more information.
## Mobile Resources

* Oculus Remote Monitor debugging client for mobile development. See [Oculus Remote Monitor (Mobile)](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-perf/#unity-perf-ovrmonitor "The Oculus Remote Monitor client (available for Windows and Mac OS X) connects to VR applications running on remote mobile devices to capture, store, and display the streamed-in data.") for more information).
## Platform SDK

* The Oculus Platform supports features related to security, community, revenue, and engagement such as matchmaking, in-app purchase, entitlement checking, VoIP, and cloudsaves. For more information on the Platform Unity plugin, see our [Platform Developer Guide](/documentation/platform/latest/).
## Avatar SDK

* The Oculus Avatar SDK includes a Unity package to assist developers with implementing first-person hand presence for the Rift and Touch controllers. It includes avatar hand and body assets viewable by other users in social applications for Rift and mobile. The first-person hand models and third-person hand and body models supported by the Avatar SDK automatically pull the avatar configuration choices the user has made in Oculus Home to provide a consistent sense of identity across applications. The SDK includes a Unity package with scripts, prefabs, art assets, and sample scenes. For more information, see our [Avatar SDK Developer Guide](/documentation/avatarsdk/latest/).
* The Avatar SDK includes a Social Scene sample, which is a Unity project illustrating basic use of Oculus Avatars and Platform features such as VOiP. See the [sample documentation](/documentation/avatarsdk/latest/concepts/avatars-sdk-unity-example-social/) for more information.
## Audio Resources

* Oculus Native Spatializer Plugin (ONSP) for Unity provides easy-to-use high-quality audio spatialization. The ONSP is included with the Audio SDK Plugins. See [Oculus Native Spatializer for Unity](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/book-ospnative-unity/) for more information. The Unity Editor includes a built-in basic version of the ONSP with a subset of features. See [Unity Audio](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-audio/ "This guide describes guidelines and resources for creating a compelling VR audio experience in Unity.") for more information.
* Oculus OVRLipSync: is a plugin for animating avatar mouths to match speech sounds (Unity 5.1 or later).
* Oculus OVRVoiceMod: a plugin used to modify audio signals, making a personâ€™s voice sound like a robot, for example, or changing their voice from male to female, or vice-versa (Unity 5 or later).
## Additional Resources

* The Facebook 360 Capture SDK allows game and virtual reality developers to easily and quickly integrate 360 photo/video capture capability into their applications. It is available for use with Unreal VR applications, and may be downloaded from the [Facebook GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebook/360-Capture-SDK).
