This section describes advanced rendering features available for the Oculus Go.
* **[VR Compositor Layers](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-ovroverlay/)**  
OVROverlay is a script in OVR/Scripts that allows you to render Game Objects as VR Compositor Layers instead of drawing them to the eye buffer. 
* **[Single Pass Stereo Rendering (Preview, Mobile Only)](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-single-pass/)**
