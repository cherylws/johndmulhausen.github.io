## Supported Unity Versions

We recommend using the Unity versions listed below. Our tests show that these builds have the best performance and least number of issues for that version.

* 5.6.5p4
* 2017.1.3p3
* 2017.2.2p3
* 2017.3.2f1
* 2017.4.1f1
* 2018.1.0f1


Our [Release Notes](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/release-archive/) describe known issues with any specific version.

All Unity versions 5.1 and later ship with the Oculus OVRPlugin, providing built-in support for Rift, Oculus Go, and Samsung Gear VR.

The optional Oculus Utilities for Unity package offers additional developer resources, and includes the latest version of OVRPlugin. When you import Utilities for Unity into a project, if the OVRPlugin version included with the Utilities is later than the version built into your editor, a pop-up dialog will give you the option to update it in your project. We always recommend using the latest available OVRPlugin version. For more information, see [OVRPlugin](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-utilities-overview/#unity-utilities-ovrplugin).

Legacy support is available for Unity 4 - see our [Unity 4.x Legacy Integration Developer Guide](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/book-integration-unity/) for more information.

For complete details Oculus SDK or Integration version compatibility with Unity, see [Unity-SDK Version Compatibility](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-sdk-version-compatibility/).

## System and Hardware Requirements

To verify that you are using supported hardware, please review the relevant PC or mobile setup documentation:

* PC SDK: [Getting Started with the SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/gsg-intro/)
* Mobile SDK: [System and Hardware Requirements](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-reqs/)


## OS Compatibility

* **Windows**: Windows 7, 8, 10
* **Mac**: OS X Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra


OS X development requires the Oculus Rift Runtime for OS X, available from our [Downloads page](/downloads/). Note that runtime support for OS X is legacy only. It does not support consumer versions of Rift.

## Unity Personal and Professional Licenses

The Unity Personal and Professional licenses both provide built-in Rift support. Mobile developers using the Unity Free license receive basic Android support automatically. Mobile developers using a Professional license require an Android Pro Unity license.

For more information, see [License Comparisons](http://unity3d.com/unity/licenses) in Unityâ€™s documentation.

## Controllers

You may wish to have a controller for development or to use with the supplied demo applications. Available controllers include the Oculus Touch or Xbox 360 controller for Rift, and the Gear VR Controller and Oculus Go Controller for mobile development.
