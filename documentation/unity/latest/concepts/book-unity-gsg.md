title: Oculus Unity Getting Started Guide
---

This guide describes initial setup, importing the optional Utilities for Unity package, and building Oculus apps using Unity’s first-party support. 

Free and Professional versions of Unity Editor 5.1 or later support Rift, Oculus Go, and Samsung Gear VR development out of the box. VR support is enabled by simply checking a checkbox in **Player Settings**.

## Utilities for Unity

To supplement Unity’s built-in support, Oculus offers an optional Utilities for Unity package which includes scripts, prefabs, and other resources. The package includes an interface for controlling VR camera behavior, a first-person control prefab, a unified input API for controllers, advanced rendering features, object-grabbing and haptics scripts for Touch, debugging tools, and more.

## Getting Started

If you are just getting started as a Unity developer, we recommend spending time learning the basics with Unity’s excellent [Documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) and [Tutorials](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials).

Our [Oculus Unity Getting Started Guide](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/book-unity-gsg/) runs through environment setup, orientation, frequently asked questions, and basic steps necessary for creating Oculus applications in Unity.

Run through our simple [Tutorial: Build Your First VR App](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-tutorial/) for a quick hands-on run-through.

## What this Guide Covers

This guide covers Rift and mobile development with Unity’s first-party support, the Utilities for Unity, and the Unity Sample Framework. Unity maintains documentation of Oculus features in their Editor in the [Virtual Reality](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VROverview.html) section of the Unity Manual.

Most information in this guide applies equally to Rift and Mobile development. Exceptions are clearly indicated where they occur. Unless otherwise noted, all instructions assume a Windows development environment.

For a complete reference for the C# scripts included in Oculus Utilities for Unity, see [Unity Scripting Reference](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-reference-scripting/).

## Additional Resources

Oculus offers additional tools to assist Unity development, including a mobile performance analysis client, Oculus Platform support for security and social features, an audio spatialization plugin, and more.
