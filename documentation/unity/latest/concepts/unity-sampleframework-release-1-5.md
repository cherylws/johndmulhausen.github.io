title: 1.5 Unity Sample Framework
---



## 1.5.1

The Oculus Unity Sample Framework assists developers in implementing Unity applications by providing sample scenes and guidelines for common VR-specific features such as crosshairs, driving, and first-person movement.

This download includes a Unity Project of the Sample Framework. VR applications of the Sample Framework are also available for the Oculus Rift from our Downloads page, and for the Samsung Gear VR from the Gallery section of the Oculus Store.

This version of the Oculus Sample Framework for Unity 5 pulls in Utilities for Unity version 1.9. Importing Utilities for Unity 5 separately is not required. It is compatible with Unity 5.3 and up - please check [Compatibility and Version Requirements](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-req/) for up-to-date Unity version recommendations.

For complete instructions on downloading and using the Sample Framework, see [Unity Sample Framework](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-sample-framework/) in our developer documentation.

**New Features**

* Added two Mono Optimization sample scenes in which near content is rendered stereoscopically and distant content is rendered monoscopically. Depending on the scene, this approach may produce significant rendering performance improvements. For a detailed explanation, see Hybrid Mono Rendering in UE4 and Unity in our Developer Blog.


**Known Issues**

* In Oculus Rift builds, Oculus Remote support is currently limited to opening and closing the menu system.
* Sample Framework Android builds use a custom manifest and are not visible from Applications, and cannot be launched from Oculus Home or the Android Application Launcher. To launch: 
	1. Install the APK to your phone.
	2. Open **Settings** &gt; **Applications** &gt; **Application Manager** &gt; **Gear VR Service**.

	6. Close **Settings**.
	7. Open **Apps**.
