Welcome to the Platform SDK Developer Guide. This guide describes how to integrate and use the features of the Platform SDK.

Before using the features in this Developer Guide, please review the on-boarding and setup in the [Getting Started Guide](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/book-pgsg/). That guide will review the process to get started with the SDK and introduce you to other Platform SDK concepts. 

The Oculus Platform features work together to create engaging VR experiences. For example, using Voice Chat, Peer-to-Peer Networking, and Rooms allows you to place users together in a virtual experience where they can interact, using avatars, in real-time. Or you can offer items for sale in VR with in-app purchases that drive additional revenue for you and additional experiences for your players. 

## Platform SDK Features

The Platform SDK features are the individual components that you can integrate in your app. Each of these features can be used independently, but using multiple in combination provides deeper, more engaging VR experiences.

* **[Achievements](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-achievements/)**  
Create trophies, badges, awards, and more to challenge your users to reach a goal or objective. Users can see the achievements their friends have earned creating a competition among friends.
* **[App Deeplinking](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-deeplinking/)**  
App Deeplinking allows you to launch users directly into an app event or gameplay mode.
* **[Cloud Storage](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-cc-cloud-storage/)**  
Seamlessly save, synchronize, and load data between devices and installs using our Cloud Storage service.

Coordinated App Launch (CAL) allows users to launch your social app together from Oculus Home.
* **[DLC and Asset Files](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-dlc/)**  
Downloadable Content, or DLC, and Asset Files allow you to add whole new experiences, characters, levels, and more to your app for sale that you may not have included as part of the original experience. 
* **[Events](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-events/)**  
Use Events to host time-specific gatherings for your users to attend, like a viewing party, social mixer, or game tournament. Events may be shown in Explore if the post matches a user's interests. Events will be shown in the Oculus Events section of Home and Oculus Explore if deeplinks are implemented. 
* **[In-App Content](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-in-app-content/)**  
Preview self-contained experiences in your app, like a video, photo set, or standalone experience with In-App Content. In-App Content may be shown in Explore if the post matches a user's interests. In-App Content will be surfaced in Oculus Search. We can show users your In-App Content post in Oculus Explore if you provide a trailer video for the post.
