title: Introduction to Virtual Reality Audio
---

Welcome to audio development for virtual reality!

This document introduces fundamental concepts in audio development for virtual reality (VR) with an emphasis on key factors that deserve development attention.

Audio is crucial for creating a persuasive VR experience. Because of the key role that audio cues play in our sense of being present in an actual, physical space, any effort that development teams devote to getting it right will pay off in spades, as it will contribute powerfully to the user's sense of immersion. This is as true for small- or mid-sized teams as it is for design houses â€” perhaps even more so.

Oculus is committed to providing audio tools and technology to developers who want to create the most compelling experiences possible. Learn about, build, and share your VR audio experiences today!

## Supported Platforms

Oculus provides audio spatialization tools for the following game engines and middleware:

* Unity
* Audiokinetic Wwise
* FMOD Studio
* Avid Pro-Tools (AAX)
* Various Windows DAWs (VST)


## Learn

Sound design and mixing is an art form, and VR is a new medium in which it is expressed. Whether you're an aspiring sound designer or a veteran, VR provides many new challenges and inverts some of the common beliefs we've come to rely upon when creating music and sound cues for games and traditional media.

Our [Introduction to VR Audio](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/audio-intro-overview/) white paper looks at key ideas and how to address them in VR.

## Build

Once you've learned about the underpinnings of VR audio, the next step is to download the Oculus Audio SDK from our [Downloads Page](/downloads/#sdk=audio) and start creating.

How you proceed depends on your engine and audio middleware of choice. If you're currently developing with FMOD or Audiokinetic Wwise, you've already finished a good chunk of the work! Our Audio SDK has plugins for FMOD and Wwise so you can get up and running right away.

If you're developing for Unity, then things are just as easy. Audio integrations for Unity 4 and Unity 5 are part of the Oculus Audio SDK. Add our spatialization component to Unity's native audio object objects and hear them in space all around you!

Audio designers can preview their sounds in most popular digital audio workstations (DAWs) using either our VST plugin or our Avid Pro Tools AAX plugin (available for Mac OS X and Windows).

Now that we've established how humans place sounds in the world and, more importantly, how we can fool people into thinking that a sound is coming from a particular point in space, we need to examine how we must change our approach to sound design to support spatialization.

As with sound design, mixing a scene for VR is an art as well as a science, and the following recommendations may include caveats.
