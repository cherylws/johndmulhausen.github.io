The Oculus Audio Loudness Meter measures the overall loudness of your app's audio mix. 

Loudness goes beyond simple peak level measurements, using integral functions and gates to measure loudness over time in LUFS units according to ITU standards ([BS.1770-2](https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-2-201103-S!!PDF-E.pdf)).

In the interest of providing a consistent audio volume experience across all Oculus VR experiences, we ask that you set a target of -18 LUFS for Rift apps and -16 LUFS for Gear VR apps. If the loudness profile of your app exceeds these thresholds, adjust your audio mix until your app no longer exceeds them.
