To download the Oculus Lipsync Unity integration and import it into a Unity project:

1. Download the **the Oculus Lipsync Unity** package from the [Oculus Lipsync Unity](/downloads/package/oculus-lipsync-unity/) page.
2. Extract the zip archive.
3. Open your project in the Unity Editor, or create a new project.
4. In the Unity Editor, select *Assets* > *Import Package* > *Custom Packageâ€¦*
5. Select OVRLipSync.unitypackage in the **LipSync\UnityPlugin** sub-folder from the archive you extracted in Step 1 and import. When the *Importing Package* dialog opens, leave all assets selected and click *Import*.
Note: We recommend removing any previously-imported versions of the Oculus Lipsync Unity integration before importing a new version.
