This document provides an overview of new features, improvements, and fixes included in the latest version of the Oculus Audio SDK.

## Oculus Audio Loudness Meter 1.0.0

Initial Release

Measures the overall loudness of your app's audio mix. Loudness goes beyond simple peak level measurements, using integral functions and gates to measure loudness over time in LUFS units. 

In the interest of providing a consistent audio volume experience across all Oculus VR experiences, we ask that you set a target of -18 LUFS for Rift apps and -16 LUFS for Gear VR apps.
