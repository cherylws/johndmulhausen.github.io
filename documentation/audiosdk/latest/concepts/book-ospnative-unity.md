title: Oculus Native Spatializer for Unity
---

Welcome to this guide to using the Oculus Native Spatializer plugin in Unity.

Before reading this guide, be sure to review the [Oculus Audio SDK Guide](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/book-audiosdk/) for information on features, requirements, and integration steps that is relevant to all of our Audio SDK plugins.

For general background information on audio spatialization, see our [Introduction to Virtual Reality Audio](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/book-audio-intro/).

* **[Overview](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-overview/)**  
This guide describes how to install and use the Oculus Native Spatializer plugin in Unity 5.2+ and in end-user applications.
* **[Requirements and Setup](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-req-setup/)**  

* **[Exploring Oculus Native Spatializer with the Sample Scene](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-scene/)**  
To get started, we recommend opening the supplied demonstration scene RedBallGreenBall, which provides a simple introduction to OSNP resources and examples of how what the spatializer sounds like. 
* **[Applying Spatialization](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-spatialize/)**  

* **[Dynamic Room Modeling](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-dynroom/)**  
The Oculus Spatializer provides dynamic room modeling, which enables sound reflections and reverb to be generated based on a dynamically updated model of the current room within the VR experience and the user's position within that space.
* **[First-Party Audio Spatialization (Beta)](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-fp/)**  
Unity v5.4.0b16 and later include a basic version of our Oculus Native Spatializer Plugin (ONSP) that makes it easy to apply basic spatialization (HRTF transforms) to audio point sources in your Unity project. For full functionality, you must import our standalone plugin into your project.
* **[Playing Ambisonic Audio in Unity 2017.1 (Beta)](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-ambisonic/)**  
The Oculus Spatializer supports playing AmbiX format ambisonic audio in Unity 2017.1. This is a beta feature.
* **[Migrating from TBE 3DCeption to Oculus Spatialization](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-3dception/)**  
This guide describes how to migrate a Unity project from the Two Big Ears 3Dception spatializer to Unity's built-in Oculus Spatializer or the Oculus Native Spatializer Plugin (ONSP) that ships with the Oculus Audio SDK, using the Two Big Ears 3Dception\_Example.unity scene found in the latest Non-Commercial 3Dception 1.2.4 package as an example.
* **[Managing Sound FX with Oculus Audio Manager](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/ospnative-unity-audiomanager/)**  
The Oculus Audio Manager provides sound fx management that is external to Unity scene files. This has audio workflow benefits as well as providing you with the ability to group sound FX events together for greater flexibility.
