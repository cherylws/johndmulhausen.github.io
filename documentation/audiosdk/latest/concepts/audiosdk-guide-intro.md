The Oculus Audio SDK provides tools, sample audio files and documentation to help you incorporate high-quality audio into your virtual reality apps and experiences.

Audio reinforces visual immersion by providing compelling auditory cues that indicate the positions of objects around the viewer, including those that are outside their field of view.

Following is a list of downloadable tools and links to relevant documentation.

## Audio Spatializers

These plugins for popular game engines and Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) enables monophonic sound sources to be spatialized in 3D relative to the user’s head location.
