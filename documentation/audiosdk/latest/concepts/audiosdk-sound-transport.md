title: Sound Transport Time
---
Sound takes time to travel, which can result in a noticeable delay between seeing something occur and hearing it (e.g., you would see the muzzle flash from a rifle fired 100 m away roughly 330 ms before you would hear it).

We do not model sound propagation time, as it would incur additional complexity, and it can have the paradoxical effect of making things seem less realistic, as most people are conditioned by popular media to believe that loud distance actions are immediately audible. Developers may delay a sound's onset appropriately to simulate that effect, if desired.
