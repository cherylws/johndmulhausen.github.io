---
This guide describes how to install and use the Oculus Spatializer VST plugin with the Oculus Rift.

Before reading this guide, be sure to review the [Oculus Audio SDK Guide](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/book-audiosdk/ "This document describes how to install, configure, and use the Oculus Audio SDK.") for information on features, requirements, and integration steps that is relevant to all of our Audio SDK plugins.

For general background information on audio spatialization, see our [Introduction to Virtual Reality Audio](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/book-audio-intro/ "Welcome to audio development for virtual reality!").

* **[Overview](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/os-vst-overview/)**  
The Oculus Spatializer VST plugin for professional Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) lets you spatialize monophonic sound sources in 3D relative to the user's head location and preview the soundscape. You can also record the mix to an ambisonic stream for later use. 
* **[Using the Plugin](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/concepts/os-vst-usage/)**  
We recommend assigning the Oculus Spatializer to your DAW tracks as an insert effect. Any sound that plays through this track will then be globally affected by the spatialization process.
* **[VST Options and Parameters](/documentation/audiosdk/latest/reference/os-vst-track-parameters/)**  
The audio tracks assigned to the Oculus Spatializer VST appear in the 2D view as colored dots. You can drag the dots in the 2D view to change their position in the soundscape and adjust other options and parameters. Click the *XZ* and *XY* buttons to change between top-down and front-facing 2D views.
