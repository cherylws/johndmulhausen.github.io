title: Optimizing Your Application
---

To provide the best user experience, your application must meet or exceed the minimum requirements to be considered for publication on the Oculus Store. 

For more information about publishing requirements, see our [Publishing](/distribute/latest/) documentation.

This section describes how to use tools we provide to optimize the performance of your application.

* **[VR Performance Optimization Guide](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-opt-guide/)**  
This guide provides actionable guidance for tracking down and solving VR performance issues.
* **[Lost Frame Capture Tool](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-lostframes/)**  
The Lost Frame Capture tool collects information about dropped frames while your VR application is running. You can then replay the dropped frames while viewing statistical data, in order to help track down performance problems within your application.
* **[SDK Performance Statistics](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-stats/)**  
The SDK performance statistics provide information about application and compositor performance on the system.
* **[Performance Profiler](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-profiler/)**  
The Oculus Performance Profiler displays a graph that shows statistics on the performance of your application.
* **[Performance Head-Up Display](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-hud/)**  
The Performance Head-Up Display (HUD) enables you or your users to view performance information for applications built with the SDK. 
* **[Performance Indicator](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-performance-indicator/)**  
Asynchronous TimeWarp (ATW) can mask latency and judder issues that would normally be apparent. To help you identify when your application or experience isn't performing and to test your game or experience before submitting it, Oculus provides performance indicators.
* **[Compositor Mirror](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-compositor-mirror/)**  
The Compositor Mirror tool displays the content that appears within the Rift headset on your computer monitor. It has several display options that are useful for development, troubleshooting, and presentations.
