Welcome to the PC SDK Getting Started Guide.

To get started with the SDK:

* Verify your system meets the recommended specification. See [Recommended Specifications](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/gsg-intro/#dg-sdk-setup-requirements "Presence is the first level of magic for great VR experiences: the unmistakable feeling that youâ€™ve been teleported somewhere new. Comfortable, sustained presence requires a combination of the proper VR hardware, the right content, and an appropriate system.").
* Install the Oculus App and Oculus Home. See [Oculus Rift Setup](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/gsg-intro/#dg-rift-setup "Before installing the SDK, Oculus recommends making sure the firmware, runtime, and hardware are correctly configured and tested.").
* Install the SDK. See [Oculus Rift SDK Setup](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-sdk-setup/#dg_hardware_setup "This section describes how to set up the SDK.").
* Get started with the demos. See [Getting Started with the Demos](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/gsg-intro-oneworld/#gsg-intro-oneworld "Now that the Rift is plugged in, the drivers are installed, and the SDK is installed, you are ready to begin using the SDK.").
* Launch third-party apps directly within the Oculus environment (Skyline and Home). See [Launching Third-Party Applications](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/gsg-third-party-apps/ "Rift applications may be accessed and launched from your Library in Home or the Oculus application, after you launch them for the first time, even if you acquired them from outside the Oculus Store.").
