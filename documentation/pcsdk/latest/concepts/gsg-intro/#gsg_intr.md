This guide describes how to install the SDK and try the demos. 

## Recommended Specifications

Presence is the first level of magic for great VR experiences: the unmistakable feeling that you’ve been teleported somewhere new. Comfortable, sustained presence requires a combination of the proper VR hardware, the right content, and an appropriate system.

For the full Rift experience, we recommend the following system:

* Graphics Card: GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 480 or greater
* Alternative Graphics Card: NVIDIA GTX 970 / AMD Radeon R9 290 or greater
* CPU: Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater
* Memory: 8GB+ RAM
* Video Output: Compatible HDMI 1.3 video output
* USB Ports: 3x USB 3.0 ports plus 1x USB 2.0 port
* OS: Windows 7 SP1 64 bit or newer, plus the DirectX platform update
Additionally, make sure you also have the latest GPU drivers:

* [NVIDIA Driver Version 355.83 or later](https://developer.nvidia.com/oculus-07-sdk-driver-support)
* [AMD Catalyst Display Driver Version 15.200.1062.1005 or later](http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Oculus07SDK-Driver.aspx)
The goal is for all Rift games and applications to deliver a great experience on this configuration. Ultimately, we believe this will be fundamental to VR’s success, as you can optimize and tune your experiences for a known specification, consistently achieving presence and simplifying development.

## Oculus Rift Setup

Before installing the SDK, Oculus recommends making sure the firmware, runtime, and hardware are correctly configured and tested. 

To install the runtime and hardware, follow the steps in Oculus Setup. If you are not running the latest firmware while using Oculus Setup, it will automatically install the latest firmware and drivers.

For more information about setting up the Oculus Rift, see <https://www.oculus.com/setup/>.

Note: Because you are doing development work, make sure to enable unknown sources. To enable Oculus to run software from unknown sources, click the gear icon and select Settings. Then, click General and enable Unknown Sources.
