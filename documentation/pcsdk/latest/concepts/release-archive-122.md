title: Changes in Version 1.22.x

## New Features for 1.22.x

* **Performance enhancement:** Occlusion mesh handling is now enabled for Unity applications with the PC-SDK. This can significantly improve performance on the Rift.
## API Changes

* There are no breaking API changes in this release.
## Known SDK Issues

* The sample project, LibOVR.vcxproj, cannot be used with Visual Studio 2010 and 2012. If you compile this project with those Visual Studio versions, it will not load. A fix for this issue is expected in the 1.23 PC-SDK release.
