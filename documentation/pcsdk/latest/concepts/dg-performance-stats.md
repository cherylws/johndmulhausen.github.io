title: SDK Performance Statistics
---

The SDK performance statistics provide information about application and compositor performance on the system.

Stats are populated after each call to ovr_EndFrame. To get performance stats, use ovr_GetPerfStats().

To reset the stats, use ovr_ResetPerfStats.

The following table describes performance statistics:

|  AdaptiveGpuPerformanceScale  |                                        Returns true if ASW is available for this system, based on the user's GPU, operating system, and debug override settings.                                        |

This value displays the amount of queue ahead time being applied (in milliseconds). For more information about adaptive queue ahead, see `Adaptive Queue Ahead`_.  .. _Adaptive Queue Ahead: /documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/dg-render/#dg-queue-ahead                                                                                                                                       |
|    AppCpuElapsedTime    | The total GPU time spent on rendering by the client application. This includes the work done by the application after returning from ovr_EndFrame, using the mirror texture if applicable. It can also includes GPU command-buffer "bubbles" if the application's CPU thread doesn't push data to the GPU fast enough to keep it occupied. Similarly, if the app pushes the GPU close to full-utilization, the work on next frame (N+1) might be preempted by the compositor's render work on the current frame (N). Because of how the application GPU timing query operates, this can lead to artificially inflated application GPU times as they will start to include the compositor GPU usage times. |

The compositor operates asynchronously and will increment for each vsync, regardless of whether the application calls ovr_EndFrame. 

The following table describes compositor statistics:

Any time spent on the compositor takes available GPU time away from the application.                                                       |
|       CompositorGpuElapsedTime       | The amount of time the GPU spends executing the compositor renderer. This includes TimeWarp and distortion of all layers submitted by the application. The amount of active layers, their resolutions, and the requested sampling quality can all affect the GPU times. |
| CompositorCpuStartToGpuEndElapsedTime |                                                   The amount of time between when the GPU completes the compositor rendering to the point in time when V-Sync is hit and that buffer starts scanning out on the HMD.                                                   |

 The Asynchronous SpaceWarp (ASW) HUD displays activity and tracking statistics for ASW, which runs as part of the Oculus Runtime Compositor. ASW automatically activates when an application fails to meet the required native frame rate for the connected HMD. Once active, ASW forces the application to run at half the normal frame rate while extrapolating every other frame. This gives the application more time to complete its work.

The following table describes Asynchronous SpaceWarp (ASW) statistics:

|       AswIsActive       | Shows the availability and current status of ASW. "Not Available" can be due to the OS and/or GPU type used on the PC. "Available - Not Active" will mean the application is successfully maintaining the required native refresh rate, so ASW is not activated. |
| AswActivatedToggleCount |                                                                                          Tracks the number of times ASW has been activated for the lifetime of the HMD.                                                                                          |
| AswPresentedFrameCount |           Tracks the number of extrapolated frames ASW needed to display, but failed to prepare in time. This can occur for different reasons, but might be caused by contention for OS resources or when the capabilities of the system are exceeded.           |
