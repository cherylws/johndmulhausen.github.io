Oculus Avatars provide a powerful and flexible way to increase presence within VR apps.

Avatars deliver true social presence with persistent identities you can take with you across the Oculus ecosystem. Bring other users' Avatars into your app, game, or experience so players can feel like themselves and recognize their friends.

Avatars also provide hand presence for Touch controllers, letting you integrate Oculus Touch interaction into Rift apps. Integrating Touch enables users to interact with their environment and enhance their perception of themselves within your virtual world.

In May 2018, with the launch of Oculus Go, Oculus released a new visual style for Avatars. This update provides a new look and feel that provides users more ways to express themselves and an updated visual fit for the aesthetic of the many VR worlds.

Integrations for the initial version of the new Avatars are currently available for Unity and Unreal. Sample code for native C++ will be coming soon.

## What’s New in Avatars?

**Cross-Platform Avatar Support** - Dependencies on the Oculus runtime have been removed, and Oculus Avatars can now be used on any platform that can use the Avatar SDK. For more information, see the Cross-Platform Avatar Support section of [Unity Developer Guide - Rift](/documentation/avatarsdk/latest/concepts/avatars-gsg-unity/#avatars-gsg-unity) and the new CrossPlatform Unity sample included with the SDK.

**Unity Shader Updates** - Includes fixes for linear lighting and fixes for PC shaders.
