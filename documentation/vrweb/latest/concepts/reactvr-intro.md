title: React 360
---

React 360 is an open-source JavaScript library for creating user interfaces and scenes in virtual reality.

The pursuit of the maximum frame rate for web-based VR experiences has meant an increase in complexity for developers. React 360 aims to simplify the process and bring VR creation within the reach of all web developers.

We combined the expressive, declarative power of React with lower-level WebVR and WebGL APIs. The result is a toolkit that lets web developers build VR experiences using primitives such as `&lt;View&gt;` and `&lt;Text&gt;`, manage layout with Flexbox, and handle complex application states using the straightforward flows of React JS.

Our command-line build tools, example code, and full documentation are available in the [ React 360 Pre-Release](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/10000000_432640827242874_7304780583471677440_n.zip?_nc_cat=108&amp;oh=a1cdbb9ca5db1d831b854f8996178891&amp;oe=5C56384F).
