title: Introduction to Oculus Browser
---

Welcome to the Oculus Browser Guide.

There are APIs and other technologies to help you create VR experiences for the browser. VR browser content can include immersive 3D scenes built with the WebGL and WebVR APIs and enhanced 2D web experiences running in VR. Everything possible today on a desktop or mobile browser is also possible in a VR browser.

This guide introduces you to the APIs and libraries to get you started developing your own VR browser experiences. We provide an overview of our Oculus Browser to help you understand how to test the experiences you build.

Many other browsers are also starting to support virtual reality experiences; by developing an experience for Oculus Browser your content should work everywhere WebVR is supported.

For details of the latest release of Oculus Browser, see the [Release Notes](/documentation/vrweb/latest/concepts/oculusbrowser-release-notes/).
