title: Native Application Framework
---
The VrAppFramework provides a wrapper around Android activity that manages the Android lifecycle.

We have provided the simple sample scene VrCubeWorld\_Framework to illustrate using the application framework with GuiSys, OVR\_Locale, and SoundEffectContext. Please see [Native Samples](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-native-samples/ "The mobile SDK includes a set of sample projects that prove out virtual reality application development on the Android platform and demonstrate high-performance virtual reality experiences on mobile devices.") for details.
