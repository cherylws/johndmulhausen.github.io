title: Application Performance Analysis
---
A guide to performance analysis during mobile VR application development. 

 While this document is geared toward native application development, most of the tools presented here are also useful for improving performance in Android applications developed in Unity or other engines.

* **[Basic Performance Stats through Logcat](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-logcat-perf-stats/)**  
A simple way to get some basic performance numbers is to use logcat with a filter for VrApi.
* **[SysTrace](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-sys-trace/)**  

* **[NDK Profiler](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-ndk-profiler/)**  
Use NDK Profiler to generate gprof-compatible profile information.
* **[Snapdragon Profiler](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-snapdragon-profiler/)**  
The Qualcomm Snapdragon Profiler allows developers to analyze performance on Android devices with Snapdragon processors over USB, including CPU, GPU, memory, power, and thermal performance.
