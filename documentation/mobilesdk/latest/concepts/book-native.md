title: Native Development Overview
---
Welcome to the Native Development Guide. This guide describes the libraries, tools, samples, and other material provided with this SDK for native development of mobile VR applications. 

While native software development is comparatively rudimentary, it is closer to the metal and allows implementing very high performance virtual reality experiences without the overhead of elaborate environments such as you would find with a typical game engine. It is not feature rich, but it provides the basic infrastructure you will need to get started with your own high-performance virtual reality experience.

This SDK includes several sample projects which provide an overview of the native source code. See [Native Samples](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-native-samples/ "The mobile SDK includes a set of sample projects that prove out virtual reality application development on the Android platform and demonstrate high-performance virtual reality experiences on mobile devices.") for details. 

Note: This guide is intended to provide a high-level orientation and discussion of native development with the mobile SDK. **Be sure to review the header files** for any libraries you use for more extensive, in-depth discussion.* **[Native Source Code](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-native-source-overview/#mobile-native-source-overview)**  
This section describes mobile native source code development.
