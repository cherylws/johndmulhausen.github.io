title: Native Engine Integration
---

This guide describes how to integrate the mobile native SDK with a game engine using VrApi.

VrApi provides the minimum required API for rendering scenes in VR. Applications may query VrApi for orientation data, and submit textures to apply distortion, sensor fusion, and compositing.

We have provided the source for VrCubeWorld_NativeActivity and VrCubeWorld_SurfaceView, simple sample applications using VrApi, to serve as references. Please see [Native Samples](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-native-samples/) for more details.

Asynchronous TimeWarp (ATW) transforms stereoscopic images based on the latest head-tracking information to significantly reduce the motion-to-photon delay. reducing latency and judder in VR applications.
