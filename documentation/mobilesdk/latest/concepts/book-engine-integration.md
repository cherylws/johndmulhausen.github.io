title: Native Engine Integration
---
This guide describes how to integrate the mobile native SDK with a game engine using VrApi.

VrApi provides the minimum required API for rendering scenes in VR. Applications may query VrApi for orientation data, and submit textures to apply distortion, sensor fusion, and compositing.

We have provided the source for VrCubeWorld\_NativeActivity and VrCubeWorld\_SurfaceView, simple sample applications using VrApi, to serve as references. Please see [Native Samples](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-native-samples/ "The mobile SDK includes a set of sample projects that prove out virtual reality application development on the Android platform and demonstrate high-performance virtual reality experiences on mobile devices.") for more details.

Asynchronous TimeWarp (ATW) transforms stereoscopic images based on the latest head-tracking information to significantly reduce the motion-to-photon delay. reducing latency and judder in VR applications.
