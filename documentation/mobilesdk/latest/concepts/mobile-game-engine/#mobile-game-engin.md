title: Mobile Development with Unity and Unreal
---
Unity and Unreal provide built-in support for Oculus mobile development. If you wish to use the mobile SDK with other engines, please see [Native Engine Integration](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/book-engine-integration/ "This guide describes how to integrate the mobile native SDK with a game engine using VrApi.").

## Unity Mobile Development

Unity 5.1 and later provides built-in VR support for Oculus Go and Gear VR, enabled by checking a box in *Player Settings*. The Oculus Mobile SDK is not required. 

We provide a Utilities for Unity 5 unitypackage that includes supplemental scripts, scenes, and prefabs to assist development. The Utilities package is available from our [Downloads](/downloads/unity/) page. 

For more information, see [Preparing for Mobile Development](/documentation/unity/latest/concepts/unity-mobileprep/) in our Oculus Unity Guide.

## Unreal Mobile Development

Unreal versions 4.10 and later provide built-in support for Oculus Go and Gear VR. The Oculus Mobile SDK is not required. 

The Android SDK is required for mobile development with Unreal. However, most Unreal developers do not need to install Android Studio or NDK. Unreal developers should follow the instructions in our [Device Setup - Gear VR](/documentation/mobilesdk/latest/concepts/mobile-device-setup/ "This section will provide information on how to set up your supported Gear VR device for running, debugging, and testing your mobile application.") guide, and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and Android SDK before beginning development.

For more information, see [Preparing for Unreal Mobile Development](/documentation/unreal/latest/concepts/unreal-gsg-mobile/) in our Unreal Developer Guide.
