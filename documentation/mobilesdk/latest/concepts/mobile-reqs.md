The Oculus Go Controller is the orientation-tracked input device for the Go. 

**Bluetooth Gamepad**

Bluetooth gamepads are also supported. However, not all brands have been tested for compliance. Developers should perform appropriate due diligence for key code compatibility when utilizing gamepad input in their application.

A gamepad is necessary for testing the sample applications which come with this release.
