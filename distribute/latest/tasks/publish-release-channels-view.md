title: Viewing Release Channels
---
You can view the state of your release channels at any time.

 The Build Dashboard for each app provides an overview of your release channels. For each channel, you will see its name, the build version it contains, the version code, the number of subscribers who have access, and the date the build was last updated. From here, you can: * Assign new builds to different channels.
* Change the users who can access a channel.
* Add new release channels.
