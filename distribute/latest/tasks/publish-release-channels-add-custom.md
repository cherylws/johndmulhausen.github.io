title: Adding Custom Release Channels
---

You can create additional release channels if you need more.

New release channels are listed at the bottom of existing release channels. When creating additional release channels, keep these points in mind:

* You cannot delete release channels. Any release channel you create is permanent.
* You cannot rename release channels. The names of your release channels are permanent.
* You cannot reorder release channels. They appear in the list in the order you create them.


To create a custom release channel:

* Click Add Release Channel on the Build Dashboard.
