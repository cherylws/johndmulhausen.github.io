The app should detect what device it's running on and use the correct controller graphics and terminology.

**Required** - Yes

## Additional Details

Oculus Go apps shouldn't mention interactions like swiping the headset touchpad. Generic controller models are also acceptable. Apps published before this requirement was implemented in April 2018 are exempt.

## Steps to Test

1. Launch the app.
2. Play through the title and observe any references to the device name and controller.


## Expected Result

Controller model, terminology and interactions are appropriate for the detected device.
