The Oculus Store is a curated showcase of the best efforts of the development community.
   
   
Oculus Store content includes:
   
   
- Games
   
- Entertainment—storytelling experiences in VR format.
   
- Apps—utility applications such as video players, virtual tours, or other interactive categories.
   
- Gallery Apps—a less-filtered collection of submissions from creators across the spectrum of VR development.
   
- Early Access—content that is interesting, playable, and well on its way to being finished. It provides a means for developers to charge for their work-in-progress, while giving early users the chance to be a part of the development process.
   
   
You can use the Oculus platform for a variety of distribution methods, including:
   
   
- Internal testing (Release Channels)
   
- Demos and experimental apps (Oculus Store Early Access or Gallery Apps)
   
- Early versions of apps in development (Early Access, Release Channels)
   
- Promotional or limited distribution apps (Oculus keys)
   
   
You can also distribute your app outside of the Oculus Store through off-platform distribution (sideloading).
   
   
   
## Release Channels
   
App distribution for internal testing is typically managed with release channels in the Developer Dashboard. Release channels let you release development builds of your app to different sets of users for testing through a "My Preview Apps" section in Oculus Home. For more information, see 
[Testing and Releasing Builds]
(/documentation/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-release-channels/ "Release channels let you distribute early versions of your builds to limited audiences for testing or other purposes. You can invite different groups of people to different channels. When you are confident your app is ready for release, you can copy your build to the Store channel and then submit it for Oculus Store review.")
  .
   
When your app is ready for distribution to the general public, you copy it to the Store release channel and submit it to us for consideration.
   
   
   
## Oculus Keys 
   
Oculus keys let you distribute apps through Oculus Home even if your app is not approved for either the Oculus Store or the Oculus Gallery. People can download and use your application after entering their key in the Redeem Code section of Oculus Home. Your apps still needs to be reviewed before we approve you for Oculus keys.
   
You have complete freedom in how you choose to distribute keys for your app. You can add expiration dates to your keys and even limit them to certain regions. Using keys to control access gives you fine control over app access while ensuring that your app gets auto-updated, appears in user libraries, and provides any other Oculus Platform features you incorporate.
   
Oculus keys are free. While we do not charge you for creating keys, the in-app purchasing fee structure remains in place even for content distributed with keys.
   
To create Oculus keys:
   
   
- Log on to https://dashboard.oculus.com.
   
- On the My Apps page, hover the mouse over an app that has already been reviewed by Oculus and approved for release, and then click Edit Details.
   
- Click the Oculus Keys tab and then follow the on-screen instructions.
   
   
You can generate single keys or many in bulk. After you have obtained Oculus keys for your app, you can distribute the keys yourself or through other stores and websites such as 
[Amazon's Digital Software store]
(https://developer.amazon.com/mac-pc "")
  .
   
   
   
## Off-Platform Distribution (Sideloading)
   
You can distribute your app outside the Oculus platform by a method known as "sideloading". To run such apps, users must enable Unknown Sources in the Settings menu of the Oculus app. See 
[Games and Apps From Unknown Sources]
(https://support.oculus.com/878170922281071 "")
  .
   
Such builds are not updated through our platform. They do not appear in anyone's Oculus Home Libraries or have access to any other Oculus features or services.
   
   Note: Off-platform builds must still meet our SDK license requirements. In particular, all reserved functions called out in the SDK license, such as home button functionality and menu operation, must be respected.
