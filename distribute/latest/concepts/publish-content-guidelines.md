Here are some basic content standards that we apply to all apps and games. The following is not  accepted in the Oculus Store:
   
   
- Pornography, including content for the purpose of sexual gratification.
   
- Excessively violent content.
   
- Hate speech, bullying, molestation, or harassment.
   
- Real-money gambling.
   
- Applications directed to children or users under the age of 13.
   
   
When it comes to depictions of violence, alcohol/drugs, or adult language, what we are likely  to accept generally falls within the threshold of an R-rating for a movie.
   
   
## Comfort Ratings
   
Comfort is very important to us. Comfort is a subjective, variable, and individual experience. However, we want to communicate to users as best we can about what they can generally expect from an app. To do so, we employ three comfort ratings: Comfortable, Moderate, and Intense. You can get a sense for how these are applied by looking through the Oculus Store catalog.
   
“Comfortable” experiences generally avoid camera movement, player motion, or disorienting content and effects. Generally, apps that have fixed camera position will be classified this way. “Moderate” experiences, on the other hand, might have more camera and player motion. “Intense” experiences usually incorporate first person camera motion, acceleration, or significant camera movement and player motion. In general, pay a lot of attention to how comfortable the experience is. Investing in comfort is worth it. Even “Moderate” and “Intense” apps should strive to be comfortable as possible.
   
   
   
## Video Container Apps
   
Unique, high-quality 360-degree videos are welcome, especially if they’re interactive. If your app is primarily video, consider integrating spatialized audio. We generally do not accept applications that only present a small number of 2D videos, nor apps that are a wrapper for a single 360 video. Also consider that Facebook itself has a growing 360 video platform at

## Data Collection
   
If your app collects data, you must clearly articulate your data privacy policy, and then abide by that policy. Comply with all relevant privacy laws. If you collect a user’s email address, the user must explicitly opt-in for both its collection and use. We are protective of our community’s email experience and do not want Oculus to be associated with unexpected email deliveries, so err on the side of user awareness. Of course, your app must abide by the laws of your country and the territories into which it will be published.
   
For mobile apps, be extra careful to remove any unused Android permissions from your application manifest, particularly those that relate to the user’s private data.
   
Apps in the Oculus Store must not contain other platforms or commerce solutions. If your app has in-app purchases and you want to distribute in the Oculus Store, you must use the 
[ Platform SDK]
(https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-iap "")
   to handle billing. Apps distributed outside of our Store may use their own commerce systems. See 
[Distribution Options]
(/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-outside-store/ "The Oculus Store is a curated showcase of the best efforts of the development community.")
  . 
   
   Note: We regret that Oculus cannot provide templates, legal advice, or other advice to assist in generating your privacy policy.
   
   
   
## Content Ratings
   
All Rift apps must be rated by the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC). All Gear VR apps must be rated by both the IARC and the Game Rating and Administrator Committee (GRAC). You can obtain ratings directly through the Developer Dashboard, in the Submission Info > Content Ratings section.
   
   
- 
   
     IARC
   
   The IARC and its member rating authorities provide ratings designed to reflect cultural  differences around the world. The IARC streamlines the rating process by generating ratings  that reflect each rating authority's standards based on the answers you provide through the  IARC questionnaire.
   You will be redirected from the dashboard to the IARC website to complete the questionnaire.  Once completed, the IARC provides age ratings that help users make age-appropriate choices. By  requesting an IARC rating, you understand and accept Oculus will disclose your application  name, organization name, and contact email to the IARC for purposes of obtaining a rating.
   
     Note: Any current Oculus Store app that does not have an IARC rating by March 1, 2017 will be  removed from the Oculus Store.
   
   
- 
   
     GRAC
   
   Oculus is certified by GRAC, the South Korean video game content ratings board, to provide  GRAC ratings for Gear VR content.
   We ask that you provide the initial age rating and content descriptors. During the Oculus  Store review process, our ratings team will evaluate your app and determine the final GRAC  rating. By submitting your app for review, you understand and agree that Oculus may submit a  copy of your app to any applicable rating agency as part of this process.
   
   
   
   
   
## Restricted Use of Oculus Name and Logos
   
The trademarks of Oculus, including its name, logo, and those of it or its partners' products such as “Rift” or “Gear VR” must not appear anywhere in your app. The exceptions are:
   
   
- References to Oculus hardware or services, for example in a “Quit to Oculus Home?” dialog box or similar UI.
   
- Models or meshes supplied to you by Oculus explicitly for inclusion in your app, for example controller models with the Oculus logo on them.
   
   
   
   
## Art Asset Requirements
   
We need to review the art assets used to present your app in the Oculus store. Some assets, such as your logo and screenshots, are required. Others, such as the preview video, are optional. Upload your art assets on the 
   Submission Info > Assets
    page of the Developer Dashboard.
   
   Note: Be sure to reserve a bleed area at the bottom of any cover artwork assets. This is the most common reason we reject art assets and have to delay releasing an app to the Oculus Store. Learn about the bleed area criteria and other guidelines in
