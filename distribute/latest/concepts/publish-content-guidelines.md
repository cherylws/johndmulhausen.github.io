title: Content Guidelines
---
Here are some basic content standards that we apply to all apps and games. The following is not accepted in the Oculus Store:

* Pornography, including content for the purpose of sexual gratification. 
* Excessively violent content (including but not limited to: torture, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, cannibalism, glorification of gore and dismemberment).
* Hate speech, bullying, molestation, or harassment.
* Real-money gambling.
* Applications directed to children or users under the age of 13.
 When it comes to mature content (for instance violence, alcohol/drugs, nudity, or adult language), we are likely to accept content that generally falls within the threshold of an R-rating for a movie. Note that even though your application may contain these elements, the use of them in marketing materials on our platform may be limited. These policies are described in more detail in the Store Asset Content Guidelines section below.

## Comfort Ratings

Comfort is very important to us. Comfort is a subjective, variable, and individual experience. However, we want to communicate to users as best we can about what they can generally expect from an app. To do so, we employ three comfort ratings: Comfortable, Moderate, and Intense. You can get a sense for how these are applied by looking through the Oculus Store catalog.

"Comfortable" experiences generally avoid camera movement, player motion, or disorienting content and effects. Generally, apps that have fixed camera position will be classified this way. "Moderate" experiences, on the other hand, might have more camera and player motion. "Intense" experiences usually incorporate first person camera motion, acceleration, or significant camera movement and player motion. In general, pay a lot of attention to how comfortable the experience is. Investing in comfort is worth it. Even "Moderate" and "Intense" apps should strive to be comfortable as possible.

## Video Container Apps

Collections of unique, high-quality 360 videos are welcome, especially if they’re interactive. If your app is primarily video, consider integrating spatialized audio. We generally do not accept applications that only present a small number of 2D videos, nor apps that are a wrapper for a single 360 video.

For single 360 videos, consider publishing to Oculus Video. Oculus Video features high quality content that demonstrates the immersion of VR in engaging short 360 videos. Visit the [Oculus Creators Portal](https://creator.oculus.com/distribute/oculus-video/) for more details on how to publish to Oculus Video.

## Data Collection

If your app collects data, you must clearly articulate your data privacy policy, and then abide by that policy. Comply with all relevant privacy laws. If you collect a user’s email address, the user must explicitly opt-in for both its collection and use. We are protective of our community’s email experience and do not want Oculus to be associated with unexpected email deliveries, so err on the side of user awareness. Of course, your app must abide by the laws of your country and the territories into which it will be published.

For mobile apps, be extra careful to remove any unused Android permissions from your application manifest, particularly those that relate to the user’s private data.

***Note**: We regret that Oculus cannot provide templates, legal advice, or other advice to assist in generating your privacy policy.*

## Payments

Apps in the Oculus Store must not contain other platforms or commerce solutions. If your app has in-app purchases and you want to distribute in the Oculus Store, you must use the [Platform SDK](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/dg-iap) to handle billing. Apps distributed outside of our Store may use their own commerce systems. See [Distribution Options](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-outside-store/).

## Content Ratings

All Rift apps must be rated by the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC). All Mobile apps must be rated by both the IARC and the Game Rating and Administrator Committee (GRAC). You can obtain ratings directly through the Developer Dashboard, in the **Submission Info > Content Ratings** section.

## IARC

The IARC and its member rating authorities provide ratings designed to reflect cultural differences around the world. Once the rating process is completed, the IARC provides age ratings that help users make age-appropriate choices.

During the submission process, you will be redirected from the Oculus Developer Dashboard to the IARC website to complete a questionnaire about the content in your application. There is no fee to request a rating, and results are provided instantaneously. By requesting an IARC rating, you understand and accept Oculus will disclose your application name, organization name, and contact email to the IARC for purposes of obtaining a rating.

## GRAC

Oculus is certified by GRAC, the South Korean video game content ratings board, to provide GRAC ratings for Mobile content.

We ask that you provide the initial age rating and content descriptors. During the Oculus Store review process, our ratings team will evaluate your app and determine the final GRAC rating. By submitting your app for review, you understand and agree that Oculus may submit a copy of your app to any applicable rating agency as part of this process.

## Restricted Use of Oculus Name and Logos

The trademarks of Oculus, including its name, logo, and those of it or its partners' products such as “Rift” or “Gear VR” must not appear anywhere in your app. The exceptions are:

* References to Oculus hardware or services, for example in a “Quit to Oculus Home?” dialog box or similar UI.
* Models or meshes supplied to you by Oculus explicitly for inclusion in your app, for example controller models with the Oculus logo on them. 
* [The Oculus Brand site](https://en.oculusbrand.com/) contains detailed information about how you're able to use the Oculus name and assets.
## Store Asset Content Guidelines

Oculus has a set of Content Guidelines that prevents objectionable and/or offensive material from release on our Platform. However, even if your game or application pass these Acceptance Criteria, if it contains allowable mature or controversial content, we have a separate set of guidelines for the marketing materials we accept on our platform. Whereas we essentially permit up to R-rated content on our platform, we ask that the marketing materials used in our store remain PG-13.

Our policies are meant to permit marketing of your content effectively and truthfully while reducing the amount of controversial marketing material seen by all of our users. This means that we will work with you to make sure that your marketing materials neither display content that could bother users nor lacks the information that they need to understand what the game or app likely contains.

Not all marketing assets are the same: some are seen more widely and some are only viewable once the users click to find out more about your product. Therefore we treat key art and cover images more strictly than trailers and screen shots.

The following imagery is restricted in the Oculus Store:

* Violence:
+ Key art and cover images must not contain:
- Gore: While representation of blood is allowable, innards, limbs, dismemberment, etc. are not.
- Realistic, direct violence: Weapons connecting with a victim (i.e. bullets, knives, fists making contact). Cartoon or clearly fanciful violence, however, may be OK.
- Violent subjugation or objectification: Fear is ok, but a victim being victimized is not.
- Guns pointed directly at the viewer
* Nudity and Sex
+ Key art and cover images must not contain:
- Genitalia, bare breasts, or bare buttocks.
- Depictions of sexual acts (even without nudity)
- Depictions of sexual subjugation, brutality, or menace
- Overtly provocative or blatantly titillating images
* Other banned imagery
+ Key art and cover images must not contain:
- Drug usage
- Racist or Hateful imagery (such as swastikas, Pepe the Frog, or similar images whether they were offensive at the time of submission or became offensive later)
Screenshots and trailers may contain the above in context and to a reasonable degree to the extent required to inform the user what is in the content. Use appropriate judgement. For instance, the following would not be allowed:

* A compilation roll of “best headshots”
* A video app with a variety of content should not focus on only the parts of their product that show scantily clad women
* News, education, and other non-fictional applications will be given more leeway. For example, a documentary on WWII might be able to include a swastika in historical context
In addition to the content requirements for assets, we also have specific requirements around composition, such as minimum font sizes and bleed areas. Learn about the composition guidelines in the [Oculus Store Asset Design Guidelines](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/10000000_2007708799495262_8508290021072044032_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&oh=5a41a1fd066453853ad1ee4880be6e93&oe=5C5CF91A).
