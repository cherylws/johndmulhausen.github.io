title: Rift Performance VRCs
---
These requirements ensure your app is responsive, performant, and able to render graphics at the quality expected for an Oculus Store app.

## Rift Performance VRCs

* **[VRC.PC.Performance.1](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-1/)**  
App should display graphics and respond to head tracking within 4 seconds of launch.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.2](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-2/)**  
App must display graphics in the headset at 90 frames per second on Nvidia 970 GPU running Windows 7.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.3](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-3/)**  
App must display graphics in the headset at 90 frames per second on Nvidia 970 GPU running Windows 10.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.4](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-4/)**  
App must display graphics in the headset at 90 frames per second on AMD 290 GPU running Windows 7.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.5](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-5/)**  
App must display graphics in the headset at 90 frames per second on AMD 290 GPU running Windows 10.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.6](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-6/)**  
App displays graphics without significant systemic judder.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.7](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-7/)**  
App must render without convergence errors or unusual distortion.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.8](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-8/)**  
App must render without visible z-fighting or depth conflict artifacts.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.9](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-9/)**  
The app should render head-locked UI elements in a compositor layer to avoid judder if the app misses frames or runs with Asynchronous SpaceWarp.
* **[VRC.PC.Performance.10](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-performance-10/)**  
The app must not synchronize animation or physics to an assumed 90Hz frame rate.
