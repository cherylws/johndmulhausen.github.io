title: VRC.PC.Performance.7

App must render without convergence errors or unusual distortion.

**Required** - Yes

## Additional Details

This is less of a concern for Unity and Unreal developers because our game engine integration always uses correct convergence. However, all developers must ensure that any pre-rendered stereo media content is free from convergence issues that could have been introduced during media production.

## Steps to Test

1. Launch the title.
2. Play through content for at least 45 minutes.


## Expected Result

Objects should render normally without distortion, stretching when moving your head, or feeling like they're being rendered too close to your face.
