Create an organization in the Oculus ecosystem and define the users who are going to be developing and managing your apps. 
   
   
## Create an Organization
   
To create an organization:
   
   
- Log in to your Oculus account and navigate to https://dashboard.oculus.com/.
   
- If you have not previously created an organization you’ll have a prompt to  
     Create New Organization
   . If you have already created an organization, you can open the dropdown at the top of the page and then select  
     Create New Organization
   .
   
- Enter the name of the organization. Choose carefully, this name will accompany any app you distribute. Select 
     Submit
   .
   
- Review the 
     Developer Non-Disclosure Agreement
   .
   
- Once you’ve agreed to the terms and select Accept, you’ll be taken to your My Apps page where you can create your organization's first app. Information about creating apps can be found on the Managing Apps page. Additional information about the release channels offered can be found in the Testing and Releasing Builds section.
   
   
   
   
## Add Users to your Organization and App
   
Once you've created your organization and an app, you can define the users who will be working on the application and what they will be doing. These roles give additional permissions that will be needed to complete the development process.
   
There are three roles you can define for an organization and the permissions for each role.
   
   
- 
   Admin - Admins have access to all development and financial information for an organization.
   
- 
   Developer - Developers have access to all development related functions; e.g. the  
     Manage Builds
    tab, the 
     Platform  Services
    tab, etc.. that are required to define, build, or manage an application. The Developer role is set at the app level, so you can add developers only for the app they are working on.
   
- 
   Finance - The Finance role provides a user access to all the financial information for an organization. The Finance role does not have access to any app development information. 
   
   
To add a user to an Organization:
   
   
- Log in to your Oculus account and navigate to https://dashboard.oculus.com/.
   
- Expand the tab of your organization. Then expand the 
     Settings
    tab and select 
     Members
   .
   
- Select 
     Add...
    for the role you would like to add a user.
   
- Enter the user’s Oculus Username and select 
     Add
   .
   
   
You may limit the apps a Developer has access to:
   
   
- In the 
     Members
    tab, hover over the user who you’d like to update. Select the dropdown and click 
     Manage Apps
   .
   
- Select the applications that you would like the user to be able to access, click
