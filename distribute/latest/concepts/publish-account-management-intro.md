title: Manage Your Organization and Users
---
Create an organization in the Oculus ecosystem and define the users who are going to be developing and managing your apps. 

## Create an Organization

To create an organization:

1. Log in to your Oculus account and navigate to <https://dashboard.oculus.com/>.
2. If you have not previously created an organization you’ll have a prompt to **Create New Organization**. If you have already created an organization, you can open the dropdown at the top of the page and then select **Create New Organization**.
3. Enter the name of the organization. Choose carefully, this name will accompany any app you distribute. Select **Submit**.
4. Review the **Developer Non-Disclosure Agreement**.
5. Once you’ve agreed to the terms and select Accept, you’ll be taken to your My Apps page where you can create your organization's first app. Information about creating apps can be found on the [App Submission and Store Review](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-create-app/ "This guide will review the process to upload and submit an app to the Oculus Dashboard.") page. Additional information about the release channels offered can be found in the [Release Channels](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-release-channels/ "Release channels let you distribute early versions of your builds to limited audiences for testing or other purposes. You can invite different groups of people to different channels. When you are confident your app is ready for release, you can copy your build to the Store channel and then submit it for Oculus Store review.") section.
## Add Users to your Organization and App

Once you've created your organization and an app, you can define the users who will be working on the application and what they will be doing. These roles give additional permissions that will be needed to complete the development process.

There are three roles you can define for an organization and the permissions for each role.

* **Admin** - Admins have access to all development and financial information for an organization.
* **Developer** - Developers have access to all development related functions; e.g. the **Manage Builds** tab, the **Platform Services** tab, etc... that are required to define, build, or manage an application. The Developer role is set at the app level, so you can add developers only for the app they are working on.
* **Finance** - The Finance role provides a user access to all the financial information for an organization. The Finance role does not have access to any app development information. 
To add a user to an Organization:

1. Log in to your Oculus account and navigate to <https://dashboard.oculus.com/>.
2. Expand the tab of your organization. Then expand the **Settings** tab and select **Members**.
3. Select **Add...** for the role you would like to add a user.
4. Enter the user’s Oculus Username and select **Add**.
You may limit the apps a Developer has access to:

1. In the **Members** tab, hover over the user who you’d like to update. Select the dropdown and click **Manage Apps**.
2. Select the applications that you would like the user to be able to access, click **Save**.
