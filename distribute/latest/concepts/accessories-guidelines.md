title: Rift Accessories Guidelines
---
This document provides design guidelines for physical and electrical interfaces on Oculus hardware products, allowing for development of compatible accessories. 

When developing Rift accessories, consider the following general guidelines:

* Avoid using LEDs in accessories mounted to the headset.
* Keep in mind that comfort is paramount, as accessories will be used during immersive VR experiences which can add a dimension to traditional user experience.
* Keep in mind that the fit of accessories, including straps, not only impacts physical comfort in the headset, but can also impact how users experience content in VR.

A VR audio system is designed to give users a sense of space and depth, enhancing the VR experience of presence.
* **[Facial Interface](/distribute/latest/concepts/accessories-guidelines-facial-interface/)**  
The facial interface for the headset sets the proper viewing distance and enhances overall comfort while wearing.
* **[Oculus Touch](/distribute/latest/concepts/accessories-guidelines-touch/)**  

* **[Mixed Reality Capture Mount](/distribute/latest/concepts/accessories-guidelines-mixed-reality-mount/)**  
Dynamic mixed reality capture requires attaching a tracked VR Object (a modified Touch) to an external camera in order to capture real-world images before they can be combined with a scene generated by a VR application.
