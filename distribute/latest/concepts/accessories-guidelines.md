This document provides design guidelines for physical and electrical interfaces on Oculus hardware products, allowing for development of compatible accessories. 
   
When developing Rift accessories, consider the following general guidelines:
   
   
- Avoid using LEDs in accessories mounted to the headset.
   
- Keep in mind that comfort is paramount, as accessories will be used during immersive  VR experiences which can add a dimension to traditional user experience.
   
- Keep in mind that the fit of accessories, including straps, not only impacts  physical comfort in the headset, but can also impact how users experience content in  VR.
