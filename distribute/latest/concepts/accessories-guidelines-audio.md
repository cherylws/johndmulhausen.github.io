title: Audio Module
---
A VR audio system is designed to give users a sense of space and depth, enhancing the VR experience of presence.

 Audio accessories must not detract from the visual user experience provided by the headset. All measurements in this document account for a worst case 16 Ω load. The impedance supported for the headset range from 16Ω to 10kΩ. 

## Mechanical Layout and Dimensions

This drawing details the audio mating features on the headset, using the Rift On-Ear Headphones as an example.

Rift HeadphonesDue to possible interference with tracking, no audio module can be greater than:

* Width: 42mm or less when measured from the side of the face to the outermost portion of the audio module.
* Height: 100mm or less when measured from the uppermost portion of the headphone module to the bottom most portion of the headphone module.
Note: In Ear Modules (IEMs) do not have any interference issues with tracking. The above requirements are for large on-ear or over-the-ear headphones.## Electrical Specifications

All measurements in this document account for a worst case 16 Ω load. The impedance supported for the headset range from 16Ω to 10kΩ. Adjust as needed. 

* DC Resistance: 16 Ω +/- 15% 
* Polarity: Top contact (towards the top of the head) is positive; bottom contact (towards the bottom of the head) is ground.
* Short Term Maximum Power: 0.282 Vrms (5 mW) 
* Long Term Maximum Input Voltage: 0.178 Vrms (2 mW) noise signal, per IEC60268-5 
* Rated Sinusoidal Voltage: 0.178 Vrms, (2 mW) per IEC60268-5 
* Rated Noise Voltage: 0.178 Vrms, (2 mW) per IEC60268-5 
* Instantaneous Maximum Sinusoidal Voltage: 0.282 Vrms, (5 mW), sine wave for 1 second on, 5 seconds off for 10 minutes at each frequency 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz
