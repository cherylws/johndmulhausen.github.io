The facial interface for the headset sets the proper viewing distance and enhances overall comfort while wearing.
   
   
Before creating a facial interface or related accessory, review the following general recommendations: 
   
   
- Materials should be resistant to compression. Use materials that can be cleaned, since they will be exposed to perspiration
   
- Should account for variance of facial features and sizes, including a variety of glasses sizes
   
- Should not change default angle of headset position on face, and should not move out of position during normal use
   
- Should not allow the penetration of light into the field of view
   
- Should not put added pressure on sensitive facial features like nose and cheeks
   
- Should not add any stress onto the headset connector slot or the strap arms of the main strap
