This guide answers common questions about publishing and distributing apps and describes the operation of the Oculus Store.
   
These guidelines we present here apply to both Rift and Gear VR unless otherwise noted. There are differences  between them, but our approach to the Oculus Store and platform is fundamentally the same for  both.
   
We believe in your ability to make delightful VR, and our store is meant to showcase the very  best efforts of the developer community. We hope you find our process to be helpful in your  own journey into this amazing medium.

   Lifecycle of an Oculus VR App
   
   The Oculus dashboard plays a key role in the lifecycle of your Oculus application. The dashboard lets you distribute builds to testers and also serves as the portal for the review processes your app must go through to be approved for general distribution in the Oculus Store.
