This guide answers common questions about publishing and distributing apps and describes the operation of the Oculus Store.

The information presented in this guide applies to both Rift and Gear VR unless otherwise noted. There are differences between them, but our approach to the Oculus Store and platform is the same for both.

We believe in your ability to make delightful VR, and our store is meant to showcase the very best efforts of the developer community. We hope you find our process to be helpful in your own journey into this amazing medium.

Be sure to review the [Oculus Platform SDK](/documentation/platform/latest/concepts/book-plat-sdk-intro/) guide for information on how to use our Platform SDK to enable features such as entitlement checks, leaderboards, and other Oculus platform features. 

* **[Lifecycle of an Oculus VR App](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-app-review/)**  
The Oculus dashboard plays a key role in the lifecycle of your Oculus application. The dashboard lets you distribute builds to testers and also serves as the portal for the review processes your app must go through to be approved for general distribution in the Oculus Store.
* **[Distribution Options](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-outside-store/)**  
Oculus provides several distribution options to meet the needs of your app and development process. This page will review the various forms of distribution supported by our platform.
* **[App Submission and Store Review](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-create-app/)**  
This guide will review the process to upload and submit an app to the Oculus Dashboard.
* **[Release Channels](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-release-channels/)**  
Release channels let you distribute early versions of your builds to limited audiences for testing or other purposes. You can invite different groups of people to different channels. When you are confident your app is ready for release, you can copy your build to the Store channel and then submit it for Oculus Store review. 
* **[Updating Published Apps](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-content-updating/#publish-content-updating)**  
You can upload new versions of your app and update its product details at any time after your app is published to the Oculus Store.
