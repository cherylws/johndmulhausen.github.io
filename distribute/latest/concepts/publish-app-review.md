title: Lifecycle of an Oculus VR App
---
The Oculus dashboard plays a key role in the lifecycle of your Oculus application. The dashboard lets you distribute builds to testers and also serves as the portal for the review processes your app must go through to be approved for general distribution in the Oculus Store.

It is important to us that you know exactly what to expect when you submit an app for us to include in the Oculus Store. We deeply appreciate the time and effort you put into your app, and want to provide the fairest and most transparent possible path to success.

## Design Considerations

Oculus has learned a lot about the baseline elements that VR apps must incorporate and achieve to be ready for consumers. To that end, there is a set of minimal technical and content standards you must design into your app to be eligible for publication in the Oculus Store. These standards help us ensure a great user experience for Gear VR and Oculus Rift owners.

For more information, see [Designing for Distribution](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-prep-app/ "All apps on the Oculus Store must meet our criteria for content and technical requirements.").

## Tech Review

The store review process checks whether your app meets all the minimum technical and content standards required for consideration. The technical review comes first, followed by the content review. If your app passes the review stages, it becomes eligible for inclusion in the Oculus Store and is then passed on to our content review team for Oculus Store classification and categorization.

If your app fails its initial technical review, we want to make sure you know why, and what to do next. We email you a detailed report about your app, showing you exactly which technical requirement(s) you're missing, and pointing you toward links in our Developer Center where you can learn about how to approach fixing the issue. You are then welcome to resubmit the app.

For more information, see [Rift Virtual Reality Check (VRC) Guidelines](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-rift-app-submission/ "Your Rift app must meet or exceed these guidelines to be considered for distribution on the Oculus Store.") and [Mobile Virtual Reality Check (VRC) Guidelines](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-mobile-req/ "Your Mobile VR app must meet or exceed these guidelines to be considered for distribution on the Oculus Store.").

## Content Review

After an app successfully passes our technical review, it enters content review, where we evaluate the app for its overall completeness, polish, and value. We expect games, videos, virtual tours, and other kinds of apps to be engaging, interesting, or useful.

We curate the content in the Oculus Store carefully and make content decisions. We take a wide range of tastes and viewpoints into consideration when we review apps. Essentially, we try to put ourselves into our customer's shoes and discern what people will enjoy and engage with.

For more information, see [Content and Design Guidelines](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-content-guidelines/).

## Approval and Release

If your app passes our review process, it will be approved for general distribution through one, or both, of the following methods: 

* Approved for Oculus Store distribution.
* Approved for Oculus Keys distribution.
We will get in touch with you by email to coordinate closely on finalizing your app, discussing a release plan, and confirming your launch date.
