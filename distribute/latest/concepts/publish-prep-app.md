title: Store Review Policies
---

Our mission is to make our platform as frictionless and transparent to developers as we can, while maintaining a high bar of quality for consumers. In general, your app must meet the following requirements:



* [Content Guidelines](https://developer.oculus.com/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-content-guidelines/): our policies around the type of content and marketing materials we allow in the Oculus Store.
* Virtual Reality Checks (VRCs): our technical and performance requirements. There are separate requirements for [Rift](https://developer.oculus.com/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-rift-app-submission/) and [Mobile](https://developer.oculus.com/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-mobile-req/).
* [Store asset design guidelines](https://scontent-sjc3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/10000000_2007708799495262_8508290021072044032_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&amp;oh=5a41a1fd066453853ad1ee4880be6e93&amp;oe=5C5CF91A): in addition to the content guidelines, we have specific asset composition requirements for image sizes and bleed areas.
* [Content Best Practices](https://developer.oculus.com/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-content-bp/): While these aren't requirements, here are some of the tips we've learned about how to present your app.
