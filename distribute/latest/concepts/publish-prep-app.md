title: Store Review Policies
---
Our mission is to make our platform as frictionless and transparent to developers as we can, while maintaining a high bar of quality for consumers. In general, your app must meet the following requirements:

* [Content Guidelines](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-content-guidelines/): our policies around the type of content and marketing materials we allow in the Oculus Store.
* Virtual Reality Checks (VRCs): our technical and performance requirements. There are separate requirements for [Rift](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-rift-app-submission/) and [Mobile](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-mobile-req/).
* [Store asset design guidelines](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/10000000_2007708799495262_8508290021072044032_n.pdf?_nc_cat=111&oh=5a41a1fd066453853ad1ee4880be6e93&oe=5C5CF91A): in addition to the content guidelines, we have specific asset composition requirements for image sizes and bleed areas.
* [Content Best Practices](/distribute/latest/concepts/publish-content-bp/): While these aren't requirements, here are some of the tips we've learned about how to present your app.
 Our decision to publish your app in our Oculus Store rests both on these requirements and on our opinion about how your app enriches the VR ecosystem as a whole. We're excited to see what you create!
