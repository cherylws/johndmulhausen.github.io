All apps on the Oculus Store must meet our criteria for content and technical requirements.
   
Our mission is to make our platform as frictionless and transparent to developers as humanly  possible. We do not want to be too prescriptive or to present a long list of rules. In  general, your app must meet:
   
   
- our content policy guidelines
   
- the Rift or Gear VR virtual reality check guidelines
   
- the app packaging requirements
   
- the product page information requirements
   
   
Our decision to publish your app in our Oculus Store rests both on these requirements and on  our opinion about how your app enriches the VR ecosystem as a whole. If you feel you are onto  something good, let us know!
