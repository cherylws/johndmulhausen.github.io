title: VRC.PC.SDK.1

The app meets all graphics and performance guidelines running on the recommended spec system specification with the specified alternative graphics card and with Asynchronous Spacewarp disabled.

**Required** - Yes

## Additional Details

Our lab tests apps using the [Oculus recommended computer spec](https://support.oculus.com/help/oculus/170128916778795/) PC with the alternative graphics card option. That is: 

* NVIDIA GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 290 
* Intel i5-4590
* 8GB of RAM
* Microsoft Windows 7
Microsoft Windows 7 does not support Asynchronous SpaceWarp and has a limited Asynchronous TimeWarp capability compared to Microsoft Windows 8 or 10. If you designed your app to run on a system more powerful, your app might not meet the level of performance we expect for Oculus Store apps.
