title: Mixed Reality Capture Mount
---
Dynamic mixed reality capture requires attaching a tracked VR Object (a modified Touch) to an external camera in order to capture real-world images before they can be combined with a scene generated by a VR application.

Learn more about mixed reality capture, VR Objects, and the difference between dynamic and static capture methods in the [Mixed Reality Capture Setup Guide](/documentation/pcsdk/latest/concepts/mr-intro/).

**Mixed Reality Capture Mount**

To securely attach the camera and the Touch controller to a tripod, or other steady camera mount, Oculus provides 3D CAD files for a mixed reality capture mount. Two 3D CAD files are provided, one for mounting a right Touch controller and one for mounting a left Touch controller. These files can be 3D printed by developers who wish to create dynamic mixed reality capture scenes. The mount is designed to be used with webcams and small DSLRs. The mount may not support the weight of larger cameras.

Note: Mixed reality capture requires only one Touch controller to function - Oculus provides two mount files to accommodate different camera/tripod/VR Object setups. The 3D CAD files are available in the [Mixed Reality Capture Mount Accessory Guidelines](/downloads/package/mixed-reality-capture-mount-accessory-guidelines/).

**Printing Recommendations**

* Print the mount using a high-quality print method Polyjet or SLS print methods.
* Use ABS, or equivalent, print materials.
**Usage Recommendations**

* Ensure that both your camera and Touch controller are securely mounted before use.
* The mounted Touch controller must have a clear line-of-sight to the sensor for best tracking.
* When mounting the mount to the tripod, you may have to use a 1/4-20 bolt and nut to secure the mount to the tripod. 
* To attach the camera to the mount, you should use a 1/2 inch 1/4-20 bolt and washer. If the bolt is longer than 1/2 inch, the bolt may bottom out in the camera and result in an unstable mount.
