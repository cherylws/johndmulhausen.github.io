These requirements ensure your app provides a user experience consistent with Oculus user interaction standards.

## Rift Input VRCs

* **[VRC.PC.Input.1](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-1/)**  
The app must not submit frames or accept input when the user removes the HMD or opens the Universal Menu.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.2](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-2/)**  
Single-player apps must pause while the Universal Menu is open.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.3](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-3/)**  
Selecting Reset View in the Universal Menu must reset the user’s position and orientation.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.4](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-4/)**  
Selecting Exit to Oculus Home from the Universal Menu must exit to Oculus Home.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.5](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-5/)**  
The app must map all the buttons a user needs to all the controllers that the app supports.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.6](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-6/)**  
The app must not claim Oculus Touch as a supported input device unless Touch position and orientation data facilitate player movement or manipulate the environment.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.7](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-7/)**  
In-game menus should be activated with the menu button on the gamepad controller or the menu button on the left Oculus Touch controller.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.8](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-8/)**  
When picking up objects within the app, use the Touch controller's grip button rather than the trigger button.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.9](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-9/)**  
If an app is “focus aware,” it must continue rendering while Dash is up, but hide any user hands or controllers and ignore all input.
* **[VRC.PC.Input.10](/distribute/latest/concepts/vrc-pc-input-10/)**  
In-application hands and controllers should line up with the user’s real-world counterparts in position and orientation as closely as possible.
