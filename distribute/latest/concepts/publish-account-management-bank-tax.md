title: Manage Your Financial Account
---
If you have an active application in the Oculus Store, Oculus provides tools that enable you to submit your banking and tax information and to view application financial metrics.

Submitting your banking and tax information Oculus is required if you have a paid app. If your apps are free, you do not need to submit this information.

Currently, you can associate one user ID with one account. To get access to these tools, contact submissions@oculus.com.

## Set Up your Banking and Tax Information

This information enables Oculus to get in contact with you and to ensure you get paid.

1. Go to [https://developer.oculus.com/organizations/](/organizations/).
2. Enter basic information about your organization in the Organization Address section.
3. Enter information about key contacts in the Contact Information section.
4. Enter tax ID information in the Tax Information section, if you will charge for any of your apps.
5. Enter banking information in the Banking Details section, if you will charge for any of your apps.
6. When you are finished, click Submit.
## Payments and Taxes

Once your banking and account information has been set up, we’ll start collecting taxes and sending you payments for app sales in the Oculus Store.

Payment and Taxes are accounted for per organization. If you have more than one organization, you’ll pay taxes and receive payments for each organization. This process is the same for app and IAP purchases. Depending on where a user is located, their app purchase will be from one of two entities. US and Canada purchases will be made from Oculus US, while purchases made from anywhere else in the world will be made from Oculus Ireland.

**Sales Tax**

Purchases made from Oculus US are considered “tax exclusive”, meaning that the sales tax is not included in the offering price and is added to the final sales price. While purchases made from Oculus Ireland are “tax inclusive”, meaning that the offering price includes any sales tax.

Oculus the calculates the tax to be withheld (varies based on the user’s location) and collects the sales tax revenue. Then, at the end of the year, Oculus submits the tax revenue collected to the appropriate tax entities.

Beginning January 2015, all companies, EU or non-EU based, were required to pay VAT based on any sales to EU users of Electronic Service (this includes games). We will remit the applicable VAT on sales from the Oculus Platform to EU users on behalf of the developer.

Beginning January 2017, we began to remit applicable VAT or GST, based on user location, to tax authorities in the following additional countries: New Zealand, Russia, and South Korea. Beginning July 2017, we did the same for Australia and India. Beginning May 2018, we did the same for Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Belarus, Turkey and Switzerland.

**App Revenue**

When a purchase is made, anywhere in the world and in any currency, the revenue from the transaction is converted into USD using that day's exchange rate and sent to Oculus. Along with the sales tax described above, Oculus then removes the Oculus Platform Fee (30% unless otherwise negotiated) to be retained by Oculus and collects the balance to be sent to the developer at the end of the monthly payment cycle.

Payments will originate from the Oculus US for US and Canadian developers, and from Oculus Ireland for all other developers. All payments will be made in USD, regardless of local currency.

**Income Tax**

When each developer onboards with Oculus, we ask for a W-8 or W-9 form to report income tax. Oculus does not withhold any income tax and developers are responsible for submitting that amount at the appropriate time. Oculus will send summary tax documents at the appropriate time for reporting and payment purposes. 

## Viewing App-Level Financial Analytics

Oculus provides several metrics that help you monitor the performance of individual apps on the Oculus Store.

To review the analytics, go to <https://dashboard.oculus.com/app/analytics/>. Select the app for which you want to view information from the list box. The initial page displays general app metrics over a variable time scale as well as some lifetime metrics about the app.

The children pages provide additional information about how the app is performing, recent user reviews, and more.

## Viewing Org-Level Financial Reports

The Oculus Platform generates financial reports that provide both an overview of the financial performance of the organization and an auditable detail of the monthly transactions.

To access the reports, navigate to [https://developer.oculus.com/organizations/](/organizations/), open the **Settings** tab, and select **Financial Reports**.

The Monthly Financial Report provides a summary, and history, of the purchases and IAP transactions over the previous month. The Monthly Remittance Report provides an overview of the monthly payment remitted by Oculus. The Monthly CSV Report provides a detailed transaction register of every purchase. Information about fields of the CSV report can be found on the [Facebook Reports](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games_payments/reports) page.
