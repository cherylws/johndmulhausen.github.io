title: Customer Reviews
---

You can respond to customer reviews from the **Review** tab in the Oculus Dashboard.

When responding to reviews, be sensitive not only to this customer but also to potential future customers. A response that comes off as callous or condescending can affect future downloads and sales. Before you even consider responding, make sure to read the review thoroughly and research the issue.
