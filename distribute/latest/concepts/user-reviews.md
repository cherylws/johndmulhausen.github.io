title: Customer Reviews
---
You can respond to customer reviews from the **Review** tab in the Oculus Dashboard.

When responding to reviews, be sensitive not only to this customer but also to potential future customers. A response that comes off as callous or condescending can affect future downloads and sales. Before you even consider responding, make sure to read the review thoroughly and research the issue. 

Be genuine and helpful in your replies. For example: 
> I'm sorry you had a bad experience with the app. is much better than: 
> I'm sorry you aren't smart enough to figure out the app. Then, follow-up by explaining the issue and the solution: 
> We had an issue where the app crashed on Note 6 devices running Marshmallow. We've fixed the issue in the latest update.## Seeing Your Reviews
